# HorizeonAccessibility
Repository for Homework 1, due Nov. 8, 2020.

For this assignment, I have edited the original files that we were given to optomize accessibilities. 
The ways in which I achieved this in the HTML file were:
    -Ensuring all links have functionality
    -Adding highly descriptive accesibility text to all images
    -Using symantic elements to specify what type of content was referenced
    -Changing file locations and names within my local directory to allow for easier reference and linking
The ways in which I achieved this in the CSS file were:
    - Reducing redundancies by only creating section-specific tags when necessary, reducing excessive class creation
    - Condensing many styles which are seen throughout the webpage into the "body" tag
    - Changing the order of tags to follow the flow of sections
    - Placed the tags for headings, images, and specialized text together for easier reference
